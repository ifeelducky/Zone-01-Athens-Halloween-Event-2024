# WHAT A HORRIBLE NIGHT TO HAVE A CURSE!

The curse of All Hallows' Eve is upon us... it is said that tonight the veil between our world and the Nether is thin, and that the **bocals of old** rise from their graves to feast on projects of pisciners and cohorts alike. If they catch you, your code will fail to compile for a thousand years, your audit rate will become negative, and your only auditors will be the tormented souls of FORTRAN developers.

But fortunately, there is a way to break the curse for your entire campus. I have left clear instructions on what you must do!

1. **Exorcise My HAUNTED CODE**  
   It is haunted by things that should not be. Find them and remove them, but donâ€™t forget them.

2. **Use Your Findings to Unlock the Old Collinwood School**  
   The place seems pretty empty, but you just might be able to find something intriguing HIDDEN somewhere.

3. **Seek Three Numbers**  
   Your Collinwood School finding will help you.

4. **Only Then Should You Search the Abandoned Places**  
   There you will find the word you need to unlock the **Secret Lab**.

We will speak again once the Secret Lab is unlocked. Take care until then!
